# GeoOps MapBox

Visualize your New Relic entities with any data using the GeoOps application and/or dashboard custom visualization.

## Getting started

1. Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following command. (If you have them installed these commands will return a version number, if not, the commands won't be recognized.)

   ```bash
   git --version
   npm -v
   ```

2. Install the [New Relic One CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) by going to [this link](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) and following the instructions (5 minutes or less) to install and set up your New Relic development environment.

3. Run the following command to clone this repository and run the code locally against your New Relic data:

   ```bash
   nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nr1-open-boards.git
   cd nr1-open-boards
   nr1 nerdpack:serve
   ```

Visit [https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), navigate to the Nerdpack, and :sparkles:

## Deploying this Nerdpack

Open a command prompt in the Nerdpack's directory,and run the following commands.

```bash
# To create a new uuid for the nerdpack so that you can deploy it to your account:
# nr1 nerdpack:uuid -g [--profile=your_profile_name]

# To see a list of APIkeys / profiles available in your development environment:
# nr1 profiles:list

nr1 nerdpack:publish [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:deploy [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
```
